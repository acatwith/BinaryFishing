# BinaryFishing

The **Binary Extractor** is a **C++ application** that can extract binary data from files. It can read binary data from a file and save it to a .bin file or encode it to a base64 file. To decode the base64 file, use the console application option 3, which will decode the base64 file and save it as an .exe file. There are two available binary extractors: **a GUI version that is only supported from Windows 7 and up, and a console version for 64-bit Windows that is available from 7 and up.** There is also another version of the binary extractor console that is supported for Windows 32-bit version. **Please note that the owner of this application, including the binary extractor, binary extractor console version, and 32-bit version, is not responsible for any of your actions and damages. Please use this at your own responsibility and liability, and only use this on your own computers or on yourself for testing purposes.** This application might be useful when you want to save your app’s binary or your file’s binary data to not lose it. Please note that this application was only written for testing purposes.
